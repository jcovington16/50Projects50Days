          Every journey is different and through your journey except what comes
          with it. There will be ups and downs. You will often want to quit, but
          I am here to tell you that you shouldn't quit. Failure is not a thing.
          There's is no failure, there is only lessons learned. Things do not
          happen over time, so understand that in order to get to where you want
          to be you must take one day at a time and each day you will grow. If
          everyone could be senior engineers over night everyone would do it,
          but that's not possible. You have value and you add value even though
          you may be new to the game. Often times I would get frustrated and
          turn on my computer. Then I remember that the struggles I push through
          today will be someone else's struggles tomorrow and because I
          experienced those struggles I can help that person through them. Trust
          the process. Just trust the process.
